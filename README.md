# Solar Storm Prediction Model using Coronal Mass Ejection Data

## Overview
This repository contains a predictive model for forecasting the occurrence of magnetic storms on Earth based on data related to Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). Coronal Mass Ejections are one of the phenomena associated with solar activity.

## Background
Solar storms, also known as geomagnetic storms or space weather events, occur when the Sun releases a massive amount of plasma, known as a Coronal Mass Ejection, into space. These CMEs can have a significant impact on Earth's magnetic field and can lead to various effects such as disruptions in satellite communications and power grid disturbances. Understanding and predicting the occurrence of these magnetic storms is crucial for mitigating their potential adverse effects.
